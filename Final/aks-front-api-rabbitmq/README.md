# aks-front-api-rabbitmq
3 microservices, one razor pages front end, one web api, and one rabbit-mq. :net Core 3.1


## Getting started

These examples were created and tested on Kubernetes from Docker Desktop and AKS.
You can check the application code from both, the front and and the api, at:

```
cd Final\aks-front-api-rabbitmq\message-queue-api
```
Or

```
cd Final\aks-front-api-rabbitmq\message-queue-front
```

Then you can open them, using Visual Studio Code, like:
```
code .
```

If we check the code from our `api` project, we can check how are we pointing our application, to consume our `rabbitmq` service

Here we can check how we use the endpoint, and how we are referencing and `environment` variable, called `RABBIT`on line 44. We are going to get more on that, later ðŸ¤“

## Deploying the application into our Kubernetes Instance (local or cloud)

First we are going to check the directory with the manifest files from all of our services

```
cd Final\k8s-manifest\
code .
```
Here we are going to see 7 files, 3 for each deployment and 3 for each of the services:

* RabbitMQ
* .Net Core API
* .Net Core Front End

The communication pattern looks something like this:

`RabbitMQ <-----> .Net Core API <-----> .Net Core Front End`

Wher the `rabbitmq` instance is `talking` with the `api`, and the `front` needs to consume the `api`

Now, we are going to check our `yaml` manifest:

```
ls -lth
```

Now we need to take a look at our files, for example, all the `*-deployment.yaml` files and check the `ENV` variables. Those are going to serve as glue, between our application to `talk`with each other and share information.

## Deploying the application into our Kubernetes Instance (local or cloud)

To deploy the application we need to be in our manifest directory
```
cd Final\k8s-manifest\
```
In order to do this, following the best practices, we are going to create a namespace `nsdemo`
<details>
  <summary>If you forget about, how to do it, you can check the solution!</summary>
  
  ```
kubectl create ns nsdemo
```
</details>

Then we need to deploy each of our files into the newly created namespace `nsdemo`, in the following order:
1. rabbit-mq-service-deployment.yaml
2. rabbit-mq-service.yaml
3. rabbit-mq-api-deployment.yaml
4. rabbit-mq-api-service.yaml
5. rabbit-mq-front-deployment.yaml
6. rabbit-mq-front-service.yaml

<details>
  <summary>If you forget about, how to do it, you can check this TIP!</summary>
  
```
kubectl apply -f aks-front-webapi-rabbit-all-in-one.yaml -n nsdemo
```
</details>

Then we are going to check our pods and services

<details>
  <summary>If you forget about, how to do it, you can check this TIP!</summary>
  
  ```
kubectl get pods -n nsdemo
kubectl get svc -n nsdemo
```
</details>

We should see something like this:

## Using NGROK, to expose our front-end service

First, we need to port-forward our service
```
kubectl port-forward service/rabbit-mq-front 8085:80 -n nsdemo
```
![Capture5](images/Capture5.JPG)

Once this is done, we can check our application running on `127.0.0.1:8085` or `localhost:8085`
![Capture6](images/Capture6.JPG)

Now we need to run from another terminal, the following command:
```
ngrok http 8085
```
This is going to create a tunnel and an `ngrok` url that it's going to expose our local application, to the internet.
Then you should see something very similar to this screen
![Capture7](images/Capture7.JPG)

Now we can open a new `browser` and check the `ngrok dashboard` at `http://127.0.0.1:4040`
![Capture8](images/Capture8.JPG)

Now, you can check any of those 2 url and you are going to see your application from anywhere on the internet ðŸ˜Žâœ”

Now you can share the first url with the trainer ðŸ¤–

HAPPY CODING!! ðŸ‘¾
